  <!-- The SuggestComponent in Solr provides users with automatic suggestions for query terms. 
       You can use this to implement a powerful auto-suggest feature in your search application.
       As with the rest of this solrconfig.xml file, the configuration of this component is purely
       an example that applies specifically to this configset and example documents. 
       
       More information about this component and other configuration options are described in the
       "Suggester" section of the reference guide available at
